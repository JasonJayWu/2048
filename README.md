# 2048
Replication of the game written by Gabriele Cirulli rewritten as a Java application.
Like the original, after each move the program adds a tile containing either a 2 or a 4 to a random square with a 3:1 bias in favor of 2.
Players can move in one of four directions (north, south, east, or west). 
Equivalent tiles merge when they are adjacent to each other and sliding in the same direction.
The goal of the game is to form a tile of value 2048.
